                    Sbeerka grew out of our collective appreciation of hoppy
                    bewerages. Inspiration struck whilst we were enjoying one of
                    Prague's many watering holes and we wanted to share our
                    opinion with the others. This happened in 1898.

                    Group focused on researching Prague's liquid cuisine and
                    after many lines of code written and tears shed, Sbeerka was
                    conceived. It's not perfect but it's our child.
